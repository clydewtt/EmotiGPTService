Service for EmotiGPT-Web

This service is developed using Python with FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.11+ based on standard Python type hints.

##### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Ensure Python 3.11 or higher is installed on your machine.

2. Create a virtual environment in the backend directory:

```
python -m venv .venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On UNIX or macOS:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
